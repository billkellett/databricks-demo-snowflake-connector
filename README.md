# databricks-demo-snowflake-connector

This project contains a notebook and other resources for a __Databricks Snowflake Connector demo__.

There are two notebooks.  One demonstrates Snowflake connectivity using standard SQL CRUD commands in Databricks. The other uses SQL MERGE INTO commands in Databricks.

NOTE: to run these notebooks, you will need:

- A Snowflake account
- Configured Databricks Secrets for User ID and Password into your Snowflake account

However, the notebooks have been saved with results from a previous run.  Therefore, if you simply want to examine the notebooks, you can import them into any Databricks environment and read through them.

To install and run this demo in your own Databricks environment:

1. Import the notebooks from the following URLs: 

- https://github.com/billkellett/databricks-demo-snowflake-connector/blob/master/notebooks/Databricks%20Snowflake%20Connector%20Demo%20-%20CRUD%20Syntax.dbc

- https://github.com/billkellett/databricks-demo-snowflake-connector/blob/master/notebooks/Databricks%20Snowflake%20Connector%20Demo_%20Merge%20syntax.dbc

2. Open the notebooks and follow their step-by-step instructions.
